# Valorant Match Summary in React
I've been enjoying Riot's new game, Valorant, and was really impressed with the UI/UX for the match summary screen that is available in-game.  My favorite is the Timeline section that  gives a round-by-round summary of the whole match.

~~The game is still in development and there is no official public API to access data yet, so for now I have just created a function to randomly generate a Match object that represents the data on the score screen.~~
~~The events panel is really interesting and I want to wait to see what data Riot will make available in their public API before getting carried away with an Events component.~~

(Update 1/16/21) Riot API is now available and this project needs to be updated. For now it still is running with dummy data just for demo purposes.
